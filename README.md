## 1.  Function realization

- Support parameter [-n] to control the number of generated subjects.
- Support parameter [-r] to control the range* of generated subjects. *(Nature number / improper fraction/ true fraction)*
- The calculation process cannot generate negative numbers in the generated subjects.
- If there is a sub-expression of the form e1 ÷ e2 in the generated subjects, the result should be a true fraction.
- The number of operators appearing in each subject does not exceed 3.
- The subjects generated by the program in one run cannot be repeated.
- While generating the subjects, calculate the answers to all the subjects and store them in the *Answers.txt* file in the current directory of the executing program
- The program should be able to support the generation of 10,000 subjects.
- The program supports the given subjects file and answer file, determine the right and wrong in the answer and count the number
- ~~Graphical user interface~~

##  2.  Packages

> Python version should be python3 and at least it works on Python 3.6 and Python 3.8. Already tested in environments below:
>
> - Windows10 Python 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.8

> Used Packages:
>
> - re / os /  argparse / random

## 3.  Usage

```
$ Python main.py [-args|-args]
```

```
 $ args
    ├─ -h --help	# Output Info
    ├─ -n	# Specify the number of generated expressions, default 100
    ├─ -r # Specify the value range of each number in the generated expression, default 100
    ├─ -a # Need to be used together with the -e parameter for correction and specify the answer file
    └─ -e # Need to be used together with the -a parameter for correction and specify the practice file
```


Example :

> Generate 100 subjects whose domain is in range from 0 to 100
>
> ```python
> python -n 100 -r 100
> ```

> Review files, need Exercise file and Answer file
>
> ```python
> python -e ./docs/Exercise.txt -a ./docs/Answer.txt
> ```

For default config, the file structure should be something like this:

```
Collaborators/
│ .gitingore
│ main.py
├─utils
│  │  Arithmetic.py
│  │  Calculate.py
│  │  constant.py
│  │  Fraction.py
│  │  Generator.py
│  │  Operation.py
│  └─  paser.py
└─views
    │  config.json
    │  GUI.py
    └─ MainWindow.py
```
